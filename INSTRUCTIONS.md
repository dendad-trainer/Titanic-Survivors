#Instructions for using the Titanic Survivors Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains two sets of artifacts, dependent upon whether you want to use an Amazon SageMaker (Or SageMaker Studio) Notebook instance, 
or whether you would prefer to use the Free Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab.

The latter is a free resource, but has several restrictions, including the fact that it is more difficult to call the AWS APIs. 
If you do call these APIs, then they are chargeable to your AWS account. So in the spirit of 'keep it free", 
the notebook for SageMaker Studio Lab makes use of SKLearn APIs rather than AWS APIs.

This document consists of the following sections:

- Background Scenario - sets the background and tells the story which you will demonstrate
- Demo Notes: using Amazon SageMaker or SageMaker Studio - this requires a full AWS account and Jupyter notebook instance.
- Demo Notes: using Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab - this just requires a free Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab account. You do not need an AWS account.
