# Titanic-Survivors
Demonstration Jupyter Notebooks for use in SageMaker Notebook / SageMaker Studio, and SageMaker Studio Lab

This repository contains the original "Titanic Survivors" Notebook, which was created when I was working as a Senior Technical Trainer at AWS. The Notebook was designed to be used in a SageMaker Notebook instance. It could also be used as a Notebook in SageMaker Studio.

In addition, in this repository, I am creating a corresponding Notebook for use in SageMaker Studio Lab, which is the free Service. However, SageMaker Studio Lab does not allow direct access to the AWS SageMaker APIs. So the actual Training should be done using SKLearn, rather than using AWS API calls. 

Work in progress.
